# SmartTouchType
A smart tool to improve touch typing accuracy and speed. Built using **Python** and **Tkinter GUI** for the **MLH Same Home Different Hacks 2020** hackathon.
The tool generates prompts with varying word lengths (lengths can be adjusted by using the slider) based on areas of improvement. <br>
